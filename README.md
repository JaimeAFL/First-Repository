# First-Repository
The first repository of my life. Feel free to throw shit at me, support me in my learning journey or comment on what improvements I can make to my code without needing to be Linus Torvalds.
I've been wanting to get into programming for a long time and I didn't know how to start. I love to learn. I may sound a bit innocent with these words but I'm an adult who simply wants to 
know how to program and learn a new skill, like how to steal the souls of redheads who don't have souls. Joking aside, I do this for pure entertainment and learning. Also, I want to have a 
have a track record of my progress and my learning in general reflected in a public way so that anyone who is interested can help me (or fill my beginner code with shitty comments). Feel free just like 
I feel free to expose myself to the public, be a clown, but at the end of the day, be a human being who wants to learn a new skill.
